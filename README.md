## AIRMET
*The best helmet is the one that's with you*

Airmet is a London based company that manufactures and resell an inflatable helmet of the same name specially designed for those regular users of cycle and other 2 wheels hire schemes. The Airmet uses cutting edge technology to provide best in class protection to the rider and once deflated takes the shape of a credit card to fit in your wallet so you always have it with you.

## Brief
The Marketing Director at Airmet wants to launch a new marketing campaign in order to raise awareness and boost acquisition.

His idea, in order to target a relevant audience, is to take over some cycle scheme docking stations and turn them into an ad.

The Director has found a free dataset online detailing historical traffic for all the cycle scheme docking stations in London. As Airmet's go to data guru, you are asked to come up with a recommendation to optimise chances for success of the campaign.

## Facts & Constraints
- After a year of existence, **5,000** Airmet™️ have been sold, all through their online store
- The Airmet™️ retail price is **£179**
- The cost to take over one full docking station (disregarding the number of docks) will be of **£200** per station per week + a **£100** one off per station for print and set-up
- Overall budget for the campaign is **£50,000**
- There are no constraints around the timing of the campaign

## Deliverables
You are expected to present your findings and recommendation including :

- Duration of the campaign
- Number of docking stations and specific locations to take over
- Detailed assumptions made in the process

You will also be asked to share the code used to analyse the data

## Assets
You are expected to present your findings and recommendation including :

## Organization

My repo is straight forward with the following structure:
* your-project folder:
- code: 2 jupyter notebooks with "Campaign timing prediction" & "Campaign Key Stations"
- data: data used for visualization purposes
